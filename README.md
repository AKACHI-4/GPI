# GPI: GPS-Based Attendance Management System

Welcome to our GPS-based attendance management system! Our web application allows you to manage attendance using GPS location data, making it easy to track attendance for events, classes, and meetings.

## Overview

This is a web application for attendance management system that uses GPS to track the location of users. The system calculates the distance between the user's current location and a predefined location to determine whether the user is within the attendance radius.
